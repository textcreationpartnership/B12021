         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is true, that it is many mens humors ſo to doe, and the reaſon thereof as I conceiue is, firſt, they deſire to make profit of the trée by felling it: ſecondly, that in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting young trées, or ſowing of their ſéedes, they thinke not to liue to reape any profit thereby during their liues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſéemeth a long time before they come to any growth: and thirdly, becauſe not any of late haue as yet written of this ſubiect, whereby they want rules and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions how to begin, and procéed: in all which I hope to giue them good ſatiſfaction, and ſo farre to encourage them herein, as where now euerie one ſéemeth to draw by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177111:7"/> the plough tayle, they will I doubt not, after more diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of this ſubiect, and duly conſidering hereof, vniforme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply their minds and labours to this generall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable buſineſſe. Omitting then all circumſtances, and to ſatiſfie your deſires, you ſhall vnderſtand, that to plant wood, or ſow their ſéedes, you muſt conſider the fatneſſe or<note place="margin">The qualitie of the ground muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for the planting of trees, or ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſeedes.</note> leanneſſe of the ſoyle, as whether it be of a good depth of earth, grauelly, ſandie, or of a watrie ſoyle, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the ground you muſt plant trées or ſow their ſéedes: as, the Oake commonly will proſper well in all kind of grounds, but in a watrie and mooriſh place; the Aller, Aſpe, and Willow trées doe beſt like of a low and watrie ground; and ſo of euery ſort of trées, you muſt according to their nature and qualitie of the ſoyle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie your ſelfe to fit it with ſuch plants and ſéed, as ſhall be moſt profit and pleaſure to you.</p>

                  <p>You begin well. I perceiue then that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of trées are not to be planted in all ſorts of grounds, but the nature of the trée conſidered, it muſt ſo be ſuited with ſuch a ground, that the plant and ſéed may the better come vp and proſper, be it Timber, Fruit trées, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of wood.</p>

How neceſſarie theſe kinds of trées are, I report me to all Seamen; and now of late, for want of other Timber, we begin to vſe them for building of houſes: and I ſée no reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but that in time we might haue as goodly trées and whole Woods of this kind growing in our owne countrey, (if men would endeuour to get them, as eaſily they may) as is in that famous Wood of <hi>Hyrcania Silua,</hi> which enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneth that fertile kingdome of Bohemia, where the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants of that countrey, in their trauaile there, doe often chop fliues or chips of thoſe trées with their hatchets, (which vſually they do walke withall, as we do here with ſtaues) and bring them home and vſe them in ſtead of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to do their buſineſſe about the houſe in the night time,

And the rather am I confirmed in this opinion, becauſe (as I haue credibly heard) the Marqueſſe of Huntley, and many other, haue diuers Woods of this kind growing in the Countie of Aberdéene in Scotland. And alſo one Maſter <hi>Thomas Bowen</hi> of Trefloine in the County of Pembroke, a Gentleman of good worth, had about fiftéene or ſixtéene yeares paſt manie young and ſmall plants of this kind brought him home by Saylers from the Newfound land, with ſome of the earth wherein they did formerly grow, and planted them together with the ſaid earth in conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places about his houſe, where they haue ſince ſo well proſpered, that many of them at this preſent are about foure foot in circuit, and alſo very high and tapering.

And now to our planting againe. Next after you haue thus planted your trées, and that they are well and firmely ſetled in the ground the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter, then towards the Spring you muſt begin to trimme and huſband them, which is a ſpeciall helpe and<note place="margin">Dreſſing and husbanding of young trees.</note> comfort to young trées for their better proſpering, if it bee done in conuenient and due time: for the more they are trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and dreſſed, the more will they proſper and grow, and eſpecially the firſt thrée or foure yeares they muſt bee moſt carefully, and that twice in the yeare dreſſed and trimmed, ſomewhat like vnto your Hoppe grounds (I meane for the wel huſbanding of the mould, and howghing vp of the wéeds, the not doing whereof would endanger their deſtruction) and that about the middeſt of Aprill, when they begin to put forth their buds, and then againe towards the end of Iune; and this muſt be done as néere as you can after ſome raynie weather, and not in hot or drie weather, becauſe the earth being then drie and turned downeward towards the rootes, it muſt néeds be, that thoſe clods of earth will lye hollow, and not cloſe vpon the root, ſo that for want of earth and moiſture the plants muſt of force die: which to the contrarie being digged in moiſt weather, the earth will then lye more néer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is true, many plants or young ſiences or ſprings grow vp naturally to goodly tall &amp; ſtraight trées, but where one doth come vp ſo well without art, there doe an hundred periſh for it, being either ouergrowne by wéedes or buſhes, or<note place="margin">Trees ſet by art doe grow ſooner and better than wild trees.</note> eaten and bitten by cattell while they are young and tender, or elſe by ſome other caſuall miſchance they miſcarrie in this their infancie. And for that you thinke ſowing of Acornes and other Timber ſéeds more profitable, becauſe leſſe charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I will preſently ſpeake ſomewhat in approuing your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the more fully to ſatiſfie and encourage you &amp; others therein: for there is no doubt, but that they will grow and proſper excellent well, and the trée that commeth vp of ſuch ſéedes, doe grow to their full height and top, which the plant doth not: but yet I hold planting to be more ſure, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: yet would I not haue men ſo farre to inſiſt vpon planting, as that they ſhould expect, that not any ſhould die: but this I ſay, that if the ground be well and orderly huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the plant carefully choſen, and ſet in the ground as aforeſaid, that then in ordinarie vnderſtanding, not one in a hundred of them will die, as experience ſheweth it true in many places, and particularly in Moorefields at London: and to that end I would wiſh ingenious and willing mindes to make tryall both of the plant ſet thus by art, and the wild trée growing of his owne accord, and I make no doubt, but that they will confeſſe with me, that the plant thus orderly ſet, will grow more in one yeare, and that alſo more comely than the wild trée will doe in two yeares.</p>

                  <p>Yes, there is yet more to be ſaid and done concerning this practiſe, which I ſhall now ſpeake of. Before then you
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177111:12"/> goe in hand to plant any young trées, you are firſt to conſider of two things; namely, the ſoyle where you intend to plant,<note place="margin">Two things to be conſidered of in planting.</note> and the ſoyle where the plant did formerly grow: for if you intend to plant vpon a barren ſoile, and take your plant from a fat ſoyle, that trée will hardly proſper at all: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if you take your plant from a barren ſoyle, and plant it in a fertile ſoyle, that trée by all likelyhood will in time proue<note place="margin">Remouing of trees from a barren ſoyle to a fat ſoyle, and ſo of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</note> large and beautifull: for the firtler the ground is, the better will the trée thriue and beautifie, as well in his verdure, as bole and boughes, if it be well ordered at the firſt, as is to be ſéene in euery place where great trées are, which ſheweth they haue béene well and carefully huſbanded. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would aduiſe, that before any doe plant young trées, or ſow their ſéedes, well to obſerue the qualitie and ſpecies of the ſoyle, as whether the production or veſture thereof, either which now is, or formerly hath béene of a comely and large proportion; namely bigge bodies, large ſpreading branches and armes, ſmoothly growing, and high tapering trées; for in ſuch layers one may with excéeding pleaſure and comfort aduenture to plant or ſow, becauſe it is to be expected (order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſeruing the foreſaid preſcriptions) that the habitude or fertilitie of the ground will againe in time produce like growthes. And it were alſo good, that at the taking vp of the plant you made a marke vpon it, to know which ſide ſtood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South Sunne, becauſe you may alſo ſo ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and it will proſper ſo much the better. Being thus planted, during the firſt two or thrée yeares, their boughes or ſmall ſprigges newly ſhooting out (as ſome are of opinion) would gently and better be taken away with the hand (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Pruning of young Plants.</note> thoſe ſuperfluous twigges doe hinder the growth of the trée) rather then to cut them with a knife, or any edged toole: and in this ſort they muſt be vſed vntill the fourth yere, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are come to that growth, then vſe altogether an ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged toole to prune them withall, if you perceiue they ſpring too thicke, and that they hinder each others growth, and leaue onely ſome few of the principall branches in the top: and this pruning muſt be done in March, the Moone

                  <p>Indéed I like well of this pruning or ſhredding of trées, eſpecially when they grow to ſome good bigneſſe of Timber, for then the Déere haue their fill of brouſing, the trée much proſpereth, and we poore officers make ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle commoditie of the remnant of ſuch brouſe wood: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo now and then for want of ſufficient brouſe for our fuell, we take a poore old doted trée or two to ſupply our wants.</p>

                  <p>M. <hi>Woodward,</hi> I beléeue you without ſwearing: for vnder the colour for brouſe for the Déere, you make hauocke of loppes, and manie times fell branches or armes of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trées, wherein my ſelfe haue ſéene ſixtéene or twentie foot of good Timber in many ſuch loppings, wherein indéed you ſhould fell boughes for brouſing no bigger than the Déere may well turne ouer with his hornes. And further, where you thinke it cauſeth the Timber trée to grow tall and large, therein you greatly deceiue your ſelfe, for the boughes once cut from ſuch a Timber trée, in that manner as you ſpeake of, be it either cut néere the bodie, or farre off, the wet and rainie weather doth then ſtraight begin to enter in, and euen from the higheſt of euerie ſuch bough ſo cut off, to the foot of the trée, the water will ſlide and ſoke downe betwéene the<note place="margin">Lopping of Timber trees do quite ſpoile them.</note> barke and the bole of the trée, and the longer that trée ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the worſe it will be, and within twelue or ſixtéene yeres after that Timber trée will grow to bee little better than a very Dottard: yet it is good euerie twelue or fourtéene yeres to lop and crop Dottard or Pollard trées, becauſe it will not hurt thoſe kind of trées, but be a meanes for them to beare more boughes; but yet lop not any trée in ſap time, leaſt that trée be in danger to periſh within a ſhort time after. But I perſuade my ſelfe the chiefeſt cauſe why you make ſuch large loppes, is neither for brouſe for the Déere, nor yet that the trée ſhould the better proſper, but it is indéed out of a deſire of gaines to ſell the loppes. And as for the taking of trées, which you are content to eſtéeme Dottard trées, I imagine many of you are as lauiſh therein, as you are in cropping of Timber trées.</p>

But Sir, you ſhall vnderſtand, that all trées decaied in the top are not accounted Dottards, though it be apparant that they are in declining, for in ſuch trées happily there may be thrée or foure loades of very good Timber. But a Dottard trée, as I conceiue, is any old trée<note place="margin">What is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted tree.</note> that beareth little or no verte, nor in which is ſcarce any tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor yet good for little elſe but for the fire: and therefore you muſt be carefull what manner of trées you take, leaſt that afterward, vpon complaint, you be called in queſtion to anſwer your offence: and if thoſe fées and allowances were prohibited as well from taking as felling, and to be allowed no more than ſhould ſufficiently ſerue for your owne fuell, the Kings Timber would be much the better preſerued.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I commend your reaſons why trées doe grow vpon Rockie grounds, but your opinion concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſetting Acornes I cannot approue, becauſe you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but one foot diſtance betwéene euerie Acorne thus ſet, which I thinke too little by much: for conſidering that when they are growne vp to bee trées, the longer they grow, the greater they will be, ſo that in the end there will bee no legges to beare theſe bodies, I meane all the ground will be trées.</p>

                  <p>You ſay well: for if there were no larger diſtance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the ſetting of them than one ſquare foot, the ground indéed would not bee able to beare them: therefore as you leaue longſtwayes but one foot diſtance, ſo alſo ſidewayes you ſhall leaue fiue or ſix féet, which will be diſtance ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and yet notwithſtanding that diſtance, if all of them doe not proſper well, and grow ſtraight and ſéemely when they are come vp (as perhaps many of them will not doe) you may then make a culling of the moſt vnhandſomeſt of them, from the other of finer and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this Garden or Nurcerie thus made, you may, when they are growne to thrée foot high, remoue of them how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you pleaſe, and to what other conuenient place about your ground you thinke fit; and begin to remoue them from the change to the full, or in the laſt quarter of the Moone, ſhe<note place="margin">The beſt time to remoue young plants.</note> being in <hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and let it be done in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, October, or Nouember, before the rootes grow to be too ſtrong, and then being planted, they will proſper much the better. And when you doe remoue and ſet theſe young plants anew, if you cut off the toppes and prune them, they will proſper the better to beare Maſte; but if you intend to reſerue them for Timber trées, then meddle not at all with the toppes of them, becauſe they will be more ſtraight, ſéeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and higher for that purpoſe.</p>

And where you thinke that none but rich Frée holders ſhould get hereby, if you had ſaid the contrarie, you had ſpoken with better iudgement: for where theſe Free-holders haue Common, there without all doubt they greatly oppreſſe poore Copy holders, Farmers, and Cottagers, by ouercharging the Common with Sheepe and other Cattell, which is more than they can iuſtifie by law or conſcience: and yet who dare complaine, or what redreſſe thereof? whereas if this Common were incloſed as aforeſaid, theſe rich Free-holders ſhould then haue certainely their equall portions as other men haue, without wrong to any the pooreſt Cottager. And whereas I perceiue you are apt enough to put a buzze into poore mens heads, by telling them, their Lord may prooue hard to them in the end, by racking of what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And doe not all men know, where Common is, there the Lord doth let his Farmes and Tenements not according to their owne proper values, but according to their true values, by reaſon of the Common? ſo that then heere is an apparance, that euerie man payeth a portion of rent for his Common lying open. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And further, where you thinke it not a buſineſſe but vpon neceſſitie, for idle perſons to be ſet on worke, in my opinion you doe not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the matter. For who doubteth but that by theſe incloſures of Paſtures, arable, or medow, planting yong Trees, or ſowing of their ſéedes, quick ſetting, and other labouring worke, will be a great meanes that poore men ſhall more often and daily bee ſet on worke to earne a penie, for the reliefe of themſelues and familie, and alſo liue more plentifully (hauing alſo their portion of inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177111:22"/> allowed them) than poſſibly they can doe vpon a miſerable bare Common: and alſo they may with more eaſe, profit, and pleaſure huſband and manage fiue or ſixe Acres, more or leſſe, of ſuch incloſure, by ſowing it with ſome profitable graine, grazing, planting fruit-trees, Hoppes, rootes, or take a yearely rent for it, than to liue vpon a bare and hard Common in extreame want, where is neither pleaſure nor certaintie of gaine, and where poore people doe daily encreaſe in number and pouertie vpon ſuch waſte grounds, and which may ſeeme rather to ſtarue Sheepe and other Cattell grazing vpon them, than any way bee compared to inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, where they may daily haue their fill, and grow large and ſound. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And for Church liuings it cannot be denied, but that they alſo will be exceedingly and moſt neceſſarily aduanced by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures: and the better by this courſe of incloſing waſte grounds. And now Sir to anſwere your obiection of the peoples tumult, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I aſſure my ſelfe, the matter being temperately and with diſcretion managed, in allotting euerie one his due, as aforeſaid, all men would rather with an applaud deſire it, than any take occaſion to oppugne it: and the late Leuellers in Northampton-ſhire is no iuſt preſident againſt this: for it ſeemeth they were poſſeſſed with a confuſed feare, that all tillage (which they ſought to maintaine) ſhould bee conuerted to paſture, which indeed is againſt the law. But by this courſe of incloſing decayed Foreſts, Commons, and waſte grounds, is intended nothing elſe, as I haue ſaid, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting ſuch waſte grounds of little or no profit to bee made arable, paſture and medow, and that as well for the good and benefit of his Maieſtie, as alſo for priuate Lords, Tenants, and poore Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagers. And if the law doe puniſh men for depopulation: how much the rather ſhould they bee commended and rewarded, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to conuert ſuch waſte grounds to more profitable vſes, for encreaſe of ſtrong and able Subiects, whereby the Realme ſhall be much ſtrengthened, his Maieſtie enriched by many more Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and other Taxes, and his people farre more wealthie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented? And where ſuch decayed Foreſts, Chaſes and Commons are, there the Inhabitants doe often take in and encroch vpon ſuch grounds, and that without any leaue, perſwaſion, or enforcement, but onely vpon their owne accord and agreement, and neuer pay Rent to the King therefore: whereupon it may be inferred, that if

                     </gap>crochments, which by law they cannot iuſtly; who doubteth but that the King may more freely make vſe and profit of his owne by incloſing and diuiding, as aforeſaid? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more, Commons that lye open are much ſubiect to ill weather, ſo as Cattell which graze vpon them are not able to continue there about foure or fiue moneths in the yeare; but if once they be made into ſeueralties, they will then become warme, and the hedges and walles which do mound them, will mightily preſerue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Cattell both from wind and weather, and which will bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſoile and make the Cattell grow more fat, to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and profit of the owners. And would you not thinke it a good and pleaſing ſight to ſée a large decayed Foreſt, or wild and ruinous piece of ground, which as it lieth is not worth perhaps ſixe pence the Acre, to be now incloſed with ditches and quickſet, and planted with many yong trées of diuers kinds, to proue worth eight ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or ten ſhillings the Acre?

                  <p>Sir, though you haue made a long diſcourſe of incloſing Commons and waſt grounds (to which argument this our good Farmer <hi>Ienings</hi> hath added, in his opinion, the true reaſons why it is to be feared and hated of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie) yet it hath béene very pleaſing, and you haue alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued good conſiderations to approue your opinion; and if the actors of this buſineſſe could with that indifferencie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage theſe affaires accordingly as you haue ſpoken, I ſée no cauſe to the contrarie, but that it might be generally deſired of all Commoners. But yet Maſter Surueyor there is one<note place="margin">One obiection more againſt Incloſures.</note> obſtacle more concerning this buſineſſe of incloſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which in my opinion is vnanſwerable; and that is, when the King or any priuate Lord haue graunted Leaſes to their Tenants who dwell (and haue Common <hi>ſans</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) in ſuch decayed Foreſts and Waſts, how can this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon be iuſtly taken in and incloſed?

For it was my<note place="margin">An anſwer to the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> chance of late to conferre with a Councellor at law, of good vnderſtanding and iudgement, about this very ſubiect of graunting Communage by Leaſe amongſt other landes, whoſe opinion was, That Tenants who haue ſuch graunts either from the King, or any priuat Lord, that they muſt not ſo farre extend their chalenge of Common, <hi>ſans</hi> number, in putting on ſo many Cattell, that they muſt eat vp the whole profit thereof, whereby the poorer ſort of Commoners ſhould liue in penurie and want.

                  <p>Sir, moſt willingly: you remember then what I haue ſpoken concerning the manner and time to be obſerued as well in planting of Trees for Timber, and huſbanding the ground, as alſo in making ſpecial choice of the Plant, and the care of weeding and trimming them afterwards, vntill they are growne to the age of thrée or foure yeares: which remembred, I will now diſcharge my promiſe in declaring briefly to you the nature and ſorts of certaine trees for fuell and building, which ordinarily do grow in England, and what ground &amp; ſoyle euerie one delighteth moſt in, for their better and larger proſpering, to the end that thoſe who take pleaſure in this practiſe, may not altogether be deluded, and fruſtrate of their paines and expectation, but may in the end reape ſome profit thereby. I told you then, that before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to plant, two things are to be conſidered of, namely the ſoyle where you intend to plant, and the ſoile where the plant hath formerly grown: for that trée which groweth vpon a drie ground and hot ſoyle, muſt not be planted in a moyſt or cold go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Next to the Withie may the Birch trée be accounted for a waterie tree, and which alſo deſireth a cold and moiſt ſoile, but not altogether ſo waterie a ground as the Aller and Withie doth: for we daily ſee they naturally grow vp and proſper in cold ſpringing grauely ſoiles, rather then in any other drie or waterie kind of ground: And this tree is verie profitable, and ſerueth well to make chercole, &amp; alſo for Turners to make bowls, diſhes, &amp; other neceſſary things for the houſe.

                  <p>Yes, I ſay not to the contrarie, but their nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to grow in low wet grounds, or néere vnto water, where they will more kindly proſper then in high and drie places which is farre from water, where perhaps with much adoe, and verie ſlow, they will put forth ſome few and ſmall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And where one ſo proſpereth well, and continueth long in ſuch a high place, there will fiue hundred proſper much better, and laſt longer, growing in low and waterie grounds. It is true, that by induſtrie they may be made to grow vpon the barrenneſt ſoile that is, but then the labour and charge muſt be verie great, which if once it be neglected, and not daily followed, and that with great care, all paines &amp; charge is loſt, and the tree will wither and die. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wherof is found by planting them in a low ſoyle, or néere vnto water fitting their kind. And ſome do alſo hold it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary after the firſt yeares planting of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to cut away all the twigs which then firſt put forth, whereby the roote may be the better fed, and alſo that the winds may haue leſſe power to ſhake and looſen them in the earth; for trées often periſh and die by ſuch vntimely accidents: therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as well to plant them well and orderly at the firſt; as to be carefull afterward in looking well to them, for a thing once well done at the firſt, is much better then when it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a ſecond doing.

And againe, thoſe who fell eight or tenne acres more or leſſe of Timber trées to make a preſent ſumme of money, they neuer reſpect any new ſpring thereof to grow againe, but ſtraight they fall to grubbing of that péece of ground ſo felled, and then conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it into paſture, arable, or medow, which they thinke to be the moſt gaines: but ſuch men in my opinion are none of the<note place="margin">Landlords who let Farmes from 5 yeares to 5 yeares, are none of the beſt husbands.</note> beſt huſbands; and they may well bee compared to ſuch Landlords, who thinke it a great profit for them to let their lands from yeare to yeare, or not for aboue fiue or ſix yeres: which ſhort time expired, they thinke they may then againe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177111:32"/> ſet it vpon the racke, and ſtill encreaſe both rent and ſine: but ſuch Landlords doe often faile in their expectation, as common experience ſheweth it true in euery poore Farmer: for if he hath his Farme but for fiue or ſix yeares, is it not likely he will then teare vp the ground, and ranſacke the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bowels thereof for his profit, and neuer beſtow coſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither to better the ſoyle with Compaſſe, or mend any Fences, or his Tenement, but all ſhall be coſt ſufficient, if it will but laſt his time, to bring in ſome little profit, during thoſe few yeares; which ended, the ground no doubt will be much more worſe than it was at the firſt taking thereof: for what reaſon hath this poore Farmer to bee at any charge thereof, more than he ſhall thinke fit, when he knoweth not whether he ſhall be tenant to it againe, or no? And what then doth this couetous Landlord get hereby, but onely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the heart of his ground is worne out, his fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces broken downe and ſpoyled, his Tenements decayed, himſelfe notoriouſly exclaimed of, and very likely to let it for leſſe, after the expiration of thoſe few yeares, than he did at the firſt.</p>

                  <p>You haue giuen two ſufficient reaſons why men doe not preſerue ſuch ſprings, to which a third may alſo be added; namely, as I conceiue, they are careleſſe, and neuer expect that any ſpring at all will come forth out of ſuch a ſtubbe or root, from which the Timber trée is felled. And your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſuch an one, who grubbeth vp whole Woods to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the ground to tillage or paſture, is very aptly applyed to ſuch a Landlord, who will let his Farmes but for ſome ſhort time: for if the ground be good when the Farmer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, it will then for thoſe few yeares well ſerue his turne, to bring in profit without any coſt beſtowing thereof: which tearme ended, and the vtmoſt of his labour and paines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed thereof, the ground then will bee much the poorer: and if at his firſt entring thereon, the ground, fence and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement be bad, he muſt then beſtow ſo much coſt thereof, as will well laſt him to haue profit thereby during that time (for more it is not likely he will beſtow) for you muſt thinke he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177111:32"/> will vſe all the ſkill of huſbandrie he can, to get his full bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit out of the very hart of the ground, and by that time thoſe few yeares are expired, both ground, fence, and houſing will be much impaired, and little aduantage this griping Landlord will get by letting of this land the ſecond time.</p>

                  <p>It is true, they neither expect or care for the ſpringing of ſuch Copies, and eſpecially many of the Kings Tenants, who hold any Springs or Copies of his Maieſtie by leaſe: for when they fell a Hagge or Spring, partly out of a deſire of vnlawfull gaines, they cut and mangle downe the armes and loppes of good Timber trées, yea and many good Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trées themſelues, in the name of Cranckes or ſhrubbed Trées, which they preſume they may without preiudice of their Leaſe, take; and partly to bare and cléere the ground of ſuch a burthen, that ſo much the ſooner it might become a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ground (of which Tenants doe make a better commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, becauſe they make more often returne both of ware and money) as my ſelfe haue found it true in my late Northerne circuit.

                  <p>Yes that they haue, and that great ſtore, and it groweth about the middeſt of the Leafe, and the Bloome thereof is ſomewhat like vnto a Hoppe, or the ſéed of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and to ſet or ſow this ſéed you muſt doe thus: Gather the ſéed before the Trée be fully couered with leaues (which is about the middle of Aprill) at ſuch time as it beginneth to be yellow, and fall from the Trée: and after they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, they muſt be two or thee dayes dried in the ſhadow, and then ſowne in good and firme ground an ynch déepe, and afterward let them be watered, if the weather proue drie: which done, and then carefully looked vnto, they will come vp and proſper verie well. Yet it is better to ſet Plants of them as you doe your Oake, for they will come vp ſooner, and proue more large of bodie and plentifull of boughes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen according as the ſoyle is where they grow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to plant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177111:33"/> the roots or impes of them, cut from the trée or root, you muſt lay them déepe in good mould, and they will proſper and plentifully come forth, and grow to bee high and tapering Trées, by reaſon they haue then ſtill their toppes: and they will beſt like and thriue in a grauellie ſoyle, as is to be ſéene about London and other places, where they grow tall and ſtraight in ſhort time. Of the great vſe of this trée I haue ſpoken before, and therefore it were néedleſſe here againe to repeat it. The third ſort in goodneſſe, is the Béech Tree,<note place="margin">Beech tree.</note> which beareth Maſte verie profitable for fatting of Swine, and it may be ſowne as your Acornes are, or young Trees thereof planted, like vnto Oaken Standils; and this Tree will grow well in any reaſonable ground, but onely in wet and mooriſh grounds: and in Barkſhire and Oxfordſhire they grow much vpon chalkey and barren ſoyles: and the time of planting them is in Februarie, when the heart of the cold weather is paſt, or rather at the latter end of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and they muſt alſo be huſbanded as you doe your Oaken Plant. The Hornebeame Trée doth much reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Hornebeame tree.</note> the Béech Trée in qualitie, and deſireth the ſame kinde of ground, huſbanding and dreſſing, as the Béech trée doth, but it is a more firme and ſolide kinde of Wood. And theſe, namely the Oake, Elme, Béech, Aſh, and Horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beame Trées, are the chiefeſt ſort of Timber trées which grow in England. And there be other ſmall Trées of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes, which would alſo ſerue well for Fuell and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries, and would much beautifie Foreſts and Parkes, and alſo proue verie commodious for Springs and Hedgerowes in Demeanes and Farme Grounds; namely, the Maple, Crabtrée, Seruice trée, Yew trée, and Haſell trée, which alſo would doe well to be ſet in places where ſcarce of Wood is, and theſe will grow and proſper well, the ground being aptly choſen for them, and huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded accordingly: For the Maple deſireth a fat and moiſt<note place="margin">Maple tree.</note> ſoyle, as in Hedgerowes of arable grounds, or in other places, where they may ſtand warme, and then they will timely put forth good branches, and the bodie thereof is a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177111:34"/> white and reaſonable firme wood, &amp; good for many houſehold vſes. The Crabtrée deſireth ſomewhat a better ſoyle to be<note place="margin">Crab tree.</note> planted in than the Maple, becauſe of his fruit, which ſerueth to make veriuice of, and which is good for many purpoſes, as well for the ſick as whole, &amp; a great reliefe to many poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alſo good foode for Déere, if they be planted either in Foreſts, Chaſes, or Parks: &amp; therefore the better the ground is where this plant or trée groweth, the larger &amp; pleaſanter will the Crab &amp; Veriuice be: the ſtocke or bodie of this Trée is good to graft vpon, and the wood of this Trée is alſo very good to make Cogges for Griſt Mills, and other things.
